KSR Avocats — Full package
Contains:
- static_site/: static HTML demo ready to upload to any web host (index.html, favicon)
- react_app/: minimal Vite + React scaffold (package.json, src/, public/) — run `npm install` then `npm run dev`
- wordpress_theme_ksr/: minimal WP theme — drop into wp-content/themes/ and activate in WP admin

Notes:
- Replace placeholder keys / links (Calendly URL, Stripe keys, Google Maps API, logo) before production.
- For security and persistence, connect React or static site to a backend for payments and client portal (recommended: use a server with HTTPS, JWT auth, and secure storage).
- This package is a developer-ready starting point. Contact me if you want full deployment or managed hosting setup.
